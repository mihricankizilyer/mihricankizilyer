### Hi, I'm Mihrican 👋

I work on building **agent-based AI systems** and **retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) pipelines**, focusing on practical, scalable, and research-informed solutions.

My interests lie at the intersection of:
- LLM-powered agents and tool orchestration
- Retrieval systems, embeddings, and vector search
- Reasoning, memory, and planning in autonomous agents
- Evaluation and reliability of LLM-driven systems

### What I Do
- Design and implement **AI agents** with tool use and memory
- Build **RAG systems** for knowledge-intensive applications
- Experiment with prompting, retrieval strategies, and reasoning methods
- Translate research ideas into production-oriented implementations

### Current Focus
- Agent architectures and multi-agent coordination
- RAG optimization: chunking, retrieval, and re-ranking
- Long-term memory and state management for agents
- Evaluating agent behavior and system robustness

### How I Work
- Research-driven experimentation
- Clear documentation and reproducibility
- Iterative prototyping over premature optimization
- Bridging theory with real-world constraints
